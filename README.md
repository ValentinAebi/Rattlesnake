## The Rattlesnake programming language, Gradient version

This branch contains an experimental implementation of the Gradient type system (Boruch-Gruszecki et al., 2024) inside the Rattlesnake language.

This work is part of my Master's thesis (EPFL SYSTEMF lab, fall semester 2024-2025).

Documentation may not be up to date. For documentation about the original version of the Rattlesnake language, see the main branch.
